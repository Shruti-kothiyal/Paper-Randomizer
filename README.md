# Paper-Randomizer

### About the Project 

In todayâ€™s world, time is a major concern. Any product that can effectively reduce time and power consumption is accepted and appreciated. Thus we are presenting an Paper Randomizer  that can reduce time consumption by replacing the conventional method of question paper generation system. It also needs lesser man power. There are provisions to enter data suitable to any chapter with freedom for specifying chapter name, number and priority. This enables an educational institute to generate question non-repetitive question papers. The Paper Randomizer automatically generates paper, per selected paper level of hardness. It also reduces costs, labor and eliminates human error. Three types of question paper can be generated : 
1. Hard Question Paper
2. Medium Question Paper
3. Easy Question Paper
